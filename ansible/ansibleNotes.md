# Ansible Overview

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It follows a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of the system rather than scripting specific commands. Ansible uses SSH for communication with target systems, making it agentless and easy to set up.

## Inventory

The inventory file lists the target hosts on which Ansible will run tasks. It can be a static file or generated dynamically.

## Playbooks

Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks and configurations to be executed on target hosts.

## Tasks

Tasks are the individual units of work in Ansible. They represent actions to be performed on target hosts.

## Modules

Ansible provides a wide range of modules for various tasks, such as package installation, file manipulation, service management, etc.

## Roles

Roles are reusable units of playbooks. They encapsulate related tasks, handlers, variables, and files into a directory structure. Roles help in organizing and reusing code effectively.
